# Skill-India-Inventory_management_assignment
I've pre-defined a dictionary{}. I could've asked the user for input but it would've been hectic, since it's a 20-elements long dictionary{}.
But I've tried to give the user a bit of free space by making changes such as add/update/replace the elements.(by use of simple if-elif-else condition)
I've then defined a variable record and converted the pre-defined dictionary{} into a record.json file. 
I've also tried calculating sales by sum() method and tried to add Total_sales to the dictionary as a new-end-element.
Then, I've defined a sales variable and imported json to convert the updated_shopping_list into a sales.json file.
It could be seen that I've also imported ast in order to "Safely execute" my code on the txt file without an exception.
That's all, I've tried to keep it simple while planning a blueprint and I did the same when writing the code since I wanted to design a Basic_Inventory_Management_project.
